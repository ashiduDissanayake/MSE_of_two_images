# MSE of Two Images

This project computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between two images using OpenCV and NumPy.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- opencv-python
- numpy

## Setup
1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Place your two images in the project directory and update the paths in `error.py` if needed.

To run the script, use:
```bash
./run.sh
```

This will print the Mean Squared Error between the two images.
